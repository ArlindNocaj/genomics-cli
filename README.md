# Nextflow sample projects for Amazon Genomics CLI

This repo contains multiple nextflow workflows for Amazon Genomics CLI (AGC).
The project shows how to run Blast with nextflow using AGC.
It also shows how to use local files in workflows, so that they get automatically uploaded to S3 and distributed to the required compute resource.
